We have incurred Amazon Rekognition charges of $110.40 in December 2024 and $49.51 in January 2025 under the "Usage Type" - "APN2-Group2-ImagesProcessed".

Upon investigation, we found "DetectModerationLabels" API calls in our CloudTrail logs, but we do not see any Amazon Rekognition collections in our account.

We need to apply appropriate cost allocation tags to these Amazon Rekognition resources that are generating the "APN2-Group2-ImagesProcessed" charges so that we can properly segregate and attribute these costs to the correct team or department.

Please advise on:
1. How to identify the specific Rekognition resources responsible for these charges
2. The correct method to apply tags to these resources
3. Any recommended best practices for cost allocation with Rekognition API usage
