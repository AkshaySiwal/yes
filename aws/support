Hello,

I have some untagged “Usage Type” entries in Cost Explorer that start with "APN2-Studio:KernelGateway-<instance type>". I believe these are part of SageMaker domain apps. My query is: Why are these not categorized under the “role” tag present on the domain these apps belong to?

Is it because the domain has custom tag propagation disabled? If yes, how can I set an SCP policy to check for custom tag propagation while creating and updating SageMaker domains?
