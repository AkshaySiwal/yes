# AWS S3 Cost Optimization Analyzer

## Overview
This script analyzes S3 storage costs across multiple AWS accounts and provides actionable recommendations for cost optimization. It performs a deep analysis of storage patterns, access frequencies, and lifecycle policies to identify potential cost savings opportunities.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Multi-Account Analysis
- Assumes roles across master and slave accounts using AWS STS
- Processes multiple accounts sequentially while maintaining secure credential management
- Handles cross-account access permissions and role assumptions

### 2. Data Collection & Analysis
The script gathers comprehensive data for each S3 bucket:

#### Storage Analysis
- Bucket sizes and object counts
- Current storage class distribution
- Tag information
- Lifecycle policies

#### Cost Analysis
- Current storage costs using tiered pricing
- API request costs (GET/PUT operations)
- Data transfer costs
- Intelligent-Tiering monitoring costs

#### Access Pattern Analysis
- Analyzes CloudWatch metrics for access patterns
- Determines optimal storage class based on access frequency
- Calculates potential savings from storage class transitions

### 3. Cost Optimization Logic

#### Storage Class Recommendations
The script determines optimal storage classes based on:
- Access frequency patterns
- Object size
- Current storage costs
- Minimum storage duration requirements
- Retrieval costs

#### ROI Calculations
For each recommended change, calculates:
- Potential monthly savings
- Transition costs
- Break-even period
- 1-year and 3-year projected savings

### 4. Reporting

#### Detailed Analysis
Generates per-bucket reports including:
- Current configuration
- Recommended changes
- Cost implications
- Implementation risks

#### Executive Summary
Provides high-level insights:
- Total storage analyzed
- Current costs
- Potential savings
- ROI analysis
- Key recommendations
- Next steps

## Why This Approach?

### Cost Optimization Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Analyzes all aspects of S3 costs (storage, requests, transfers)
   - Considers both immediate and long-term cost implications

2. **Risk-Aware Recommendations**
   - Accounts for minimum storage durations
   - Calculates transition costs
   - Considers access pattern variations

3. **Practical Implementation**
   - Provides actionable recommendations
   - Calculates ROI and break-even periods
   - Prioritizes high-impact changes

### Technical Design Choices

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate functions for different types of calculations
